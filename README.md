# ICU Mortality Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts ICU patient mortality using demographic data, severity of illness, and physiological features from day 3 of admission.  
Built an end-to-end ML pipeline with data preprocessing, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and model comparison.

## Features
- Preprocessing: missing value imputation, duplicate removal, one-hot encoding
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA
- Models compared: SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree
- Best model: **SVM** (F1 â‰ˆ 0.747 on evaluation set)

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/singhsahil99/Project_1.git
   cd Project_1
